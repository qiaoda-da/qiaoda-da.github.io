Hi there! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the **Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)**. I work in the State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems. I earned my bachelor's degree from **Hebei University of Technology** in 2016.

My research interest lies at the intersection of **3D scene understanding**, **video understanding**, and **3D Vision-Language Models (3D VLMs)**. I am currently focused on enabling VLMs to learn and infer 3D structural and geometric information solely based on video inputs. Through my research, I aim to create methods that allow systems to effectively interpret spatial-temporal sensory input and build a comprehensive representation of the 3D world, facilitating better reasoning about complex physical environments.
